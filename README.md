# Analysis of Phone Call Data from Hair Salons and Barber Shops in Seoul
## Executive Summary
The client has phone call data collected from hair salons and barber shops in Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. The variables are date, day, gender, age, district, county, and number of phone calls. The interest of this project is how the phone calls are related to date (or day), gender, district, and county. Since the counties in Seoul are very small, I focus on the districts. Since my client is not professional in Statistics, I mostly use the data visualization method.

## Introduction
Korea Master Beautician Association promotes technology improvement and conducts educational and public relations projects for the development of the Korean beauty industry. My client has phone call data collected from hair salons and barber shops in Seoul through the association. The data have information of demographics and daily phone calls from September 1st to 30th, 2019. The main question is how the phone calls are related to day, gender, and location.

## Data
Since the data were collected in Korean, I translated them to English. Phone calls less than 5 were counted as just 5. The original data had district and county information of callers. Since the counties in Seoul are very small, I decided to focus on the district information only. After omitting the county data, the number of calls in the same district were counted separately even though all of the other demographics were identical. Hence, I combined the number of calls based on the
district. After performing all these steps, there were 7,936 observations out of 21,317 left.

## Analysis


## Conclusion
Regardless of day, age and gender, three districts—Gangnam, Seocho, and Jung—had the top 3 phone calls among 25 districts in Seoul (Figure 2, 4 and 7). Also, regardless of district and age, people tended to make a phone call to hair salons or barber shops on Tuesday at most (Figure 2 and 3). Overall, women made more phone calls to salons regardless of day and location. However, teenage boys tended make more than twice calls than girls. Based on this research, the results may
help to define the target market using the demographics such as age, gender, district, or day.
