# Analysis of Phone Call Data from Hair Salons and Barber Shops in Seoul
## Executive Summary
The client has phone call data collected from hair salons and barber shops in Seoul, the capital city of South Korea. The variables are date, day, gender, age, district, county, and number of phone calls. The interest of this project is how the phone calls are related to date (or day), gender, district, and county. Since the counties in Seoul are very small, I focus on the districts. Since my client is not professional in Statistics, I mostly use the data visualization method.
